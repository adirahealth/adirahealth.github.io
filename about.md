This pandemic of 2020 has taught us many lessons. We all went through many ups and downs. “Health is Wealth” was the most important thing I learnt. “Survival of the Fittest” was the experience quote everyone went through every day of 2020. \\
\\
We lived a minimalistic life in true sense; which made me realise we may have been living a very superficial life. Taught us the real difference between *needs* and *wants*.’ \\
\\
Everybody prioritized immunity building, Exercising over everything else.  Thankfully we live in a health Conscious society now. But as there are two sides to a coin, in the same way the side effects we all faced were  \\
\\
*Work from Home* \\
\\
*All work had to be distributed among the family members* \\
\\
*Schools were closed and kids needed to be engaged at home itself*. \\
\\
Husssh… \\
\\
So, these all things ignited ADIRA’s ideas. We came up with product which are Healthy, easy to use and can be prepared within no time. These products will increase our immunity due to high Protein content as well as save our time. ADIRA’s ready-to-eat dishes are ‘A perfect blend of technology and health’ and thus we can pamper ourselves with *preservative free* protein rich delicious Mushroom dishes. \\
\\
  Pamper yourself with our Pure Vegetarian Delicious Mushroom meals after our hectic work schedule. Give yourself a break from Kitchen and enjoy your *family time*. \\
  \\
A Shoutout to traveller’s out there. ADIRA presents to you Travel Friendly Mushroom Dishes. Always carry these dishes to save yourself from the uncertain & unexpected travelling experiences.  \\
